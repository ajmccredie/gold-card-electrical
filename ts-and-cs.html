        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            These terms and conditions apply to all courses booked with us, Gold Card Electrical Training (company registration number 13456667, referred to in these terms and conditions as “Gold Card”).
These terms apply to you whether you are booking a course for yourself or on behalf of one or more other people (such as a relative or your employees or contractors). Where these terms refer to “you”, this means the person who is placing the booking, whether or not you are the person attending the course. Where these terms refer to the “Candidate”, this means the person or people who will be attending the course, whether that is you or a person you are booking on behalf of.
If you are booking a course for yourself, you must comply with all of the obligations set out in the terms and conditions, whether they refer to “you” or the “Candidate”. If you are booking on behalf of one or more other people, you must comply with the obligations which refer to “you” and you must ensure that the person or people you are booking on behalf of comply with all the obligations that refer to the “Candidate”.
YOU SHOULD READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN FULL CAREFULLY, IN PARTICULAR (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) YOUR CANCELLATION RIGHTS UNDER TERM 5, THE RULES GOVERNING GOLD CARDS LIABILITY AT TERM 8, AND THE PROVISIONS REGARDING THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AT TERM 14.
1 Placing a booking
1.1 If you wish to book a place on one our courses, you may do so either via email, by telephone or in person. Provided that there is an available place on the course (and Gold Card is otherwise able to accept your booking) it will email a confirmation of your booking.

1.2 Acceptance of a booking by Gold Card does not constitute enrolment on the selected course. Once your booking has been accepted, Gold Card will assess the information provided with your booking and consider whether it believes the Candidate is eligible to be enrolled on the course and whether the course is otherwise appropriate for the Candidate. To enable it to make this assessment, Gold Card may require the Candidate to undertake an interview before confirming enrolment. Gold Card reserves the right to refuse enrolment on the course for any reason.

1.3 If Gold Card declines to enrol the Candidate for any reason or if, after accepting the Candidate’s enrolment Gold Card subsequently discovers information which gives it reasonable grounds to believe that the course is not appropriate for the Candidate for any reason, Gold Card may cancel the booking and will notify you accordingly. Where this happens then, unless the reason for the cancellation was your non-compliance with the terms (including, where you are booking on behalf of someone else, your failure to ensure that the Candidate complies with the obligations applicable to him/her) Gold Card will give you a full refund of any sums you have already paid.

1.4 Whilst Gold Card will take all reasonable steps to make courses as inclusive as possible, it is essential that you are aware of the following:
1.4.1 all courses are     delivered in English;
1.4.2 workshops and     assessments require a reasonable level of physical fitness and health; and
1.4.3 electrical work is     heavily regulated and, if not properly performed, potentially dangerous,     and therefore courses are designed for (and only suitable for) individuals     intending to use the skills developed in the course of their trade.

1.5 By placing a booking you confirm that the Candidate can understand spoken English and write and read proficiently in English, has a reasonable level of physical fitness and health and is either already working in the electrical industry or is intending to enter the industry. If you have any doubt as to whether the Candidate meets these requirements you should discuss any issues with Gold Card before placing the booking (and, in the case of any issues with fitness or health, seek a professional opinion from a qualified medical expert).

1.6 Gold Card accepts no liability for any adverse consequences arising from a Candidate’s participation in a course which arose as a result of the Candidate not meeting the eligibility requirements described in term 1.5.

1,7 Provisional bookings can be made by telephone and held for 2 weeks or until 2 weeks prior to the course start date, whichever is sooner. Bookings are not secured until a signed booking form has been received, with a deposit. While a booking still provisional, Gold Card reserves the right to allocate the place to another customer. Provisional bookings will only be held for up to 14 days.
1.8 If you would like to make a delegate substitution, please contact us. An administration charge may be incurred to cover registration fees.
2 Payment of Fees
